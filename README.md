## My process

The first step on this app was to understand the requirements and see the design file to analyze if it would be best to use Flexbox or the grid system.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript (ES6)

### What I learned

This was a simple project to practice ES6 features and I did practice most of what I have learned with this project
